## Architecture Overview

- **Frontend:** React 18+, TypeScript, Material UI  
- **Backend:** Spring Boot 3 (Java 21+), REST API, WebSocket support  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Docker:** Ready to run the full stack in containers

---
## First clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/konris39/TrainGymAppCalendar.git
```

## Frontend Setup

Requirements:  
- Node.js 18+  
- npm or pnpm

```bash
cd train-gym-app-calendar-frontend

npm install
npm start
```

Frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Backend Setup

Requirements:  
- Java 21+  
- Maven  
- PostgreSQL

1. **Create a PostgreSQL database:**  
   For example, `traingymapp`.

2. **Set up database credentials** in `application.yml`:
    ```yaml
    spring:
      datasource:
        url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/traingymapp
        username: your_db_user
        password: your_db_password
    ```

3. **Build and run backend:**
    ```bash
    cd TrainGymAppCalendarBackend

    mvn clean install
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

Backend will be running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Run With Docker üê≥ (Optional and recommended for simplicity)

You can run the whole app stack with Docker:

If running for the first time:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
if not first time then:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## ERD Diagram

Below is the ERD Diagram illustrating the application's database structure:

![ERD](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ad9a6e3-063e-475a-8e17-393cca6bcfd3)

**Description:**

- **users** ‚Äì Stores user data such as email, username, password, admin status, and trainer status.
- **training** ‚Äì Contains information about trainings (date, name, description, acceptance and completion status, user associations).
- **data_user** ‚Äì Stores users' physical data (age, height, weight, strength results, BMI, totals).
- **recommended_trainings** ‚Äì Catalog of recommended trainings with description and type.
- **user_recommended_trainings** ‚Äì Connects users with recommended trainings (many-to-many relationship).
- **user_group** ‚Äì Represents group membership managed by trainers (many-to-many relationship via trainer_id and user_id).

The relationships are defined via foreign keys and join tables where many-to-many relations are needed.

---

## Tests

The backend is covered by a comprehensive set of unit and integration tests. 
Tests are written using **JUnit 5** and **Spring Boot Test**, covering business logic and various cases.

To run all tests locally, use:

```bash
./mvnw test
```

or

```bash
mvn clean test
```

## Technologies Used

- **React 18 + TypeScript** ‚Äì Modern framework, great ecosystem.
- **Material UI** ‚Äì Responsive, ready to use React UI components.
- **Spring Boot 3 (Java 21+)** ‚Äì Fast, secure backend with REST API, security, WebSocket & Kafka integration.
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Relational, transactional database, ideal for structured data.
- **Docker** ‚Äì Simplifies running the entire app.
- **WebSocket & Kafka** ‚Äì Real time notifications.
